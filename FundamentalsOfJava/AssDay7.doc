Q1 What is statically typed and Dynamically typed Programming Language?

Ans:Statically typed: Programming languages are referred to as "Static typed" if the
memory of the variable is provided at the time of compilation.

For instance, C, C++, and Java

Dynamically typed: Programming languages are said to as "dynamically typed"
if the memory for the variable is provided at the time of execution.

Like Python, PHP, and JavaScript

Q2. What is the variable in Java?

Ans: A variable is the name of a memory-allocated reserved area. It may be thought of as
the name of a memory location, in other words.

Q3. How To Assing a Value To Variable?

Ans: The name of a variable is variable_name. The variable can be initialised by
supplying an equal sign and a value (initialization i.e. assigning an initial value, is
optional). However, a Java uninitialized local variable is never given a default
value by the compiler.

Q4. What are Primitive Data types in Java?

Ans: A primitive type is predefined by the language and is named by a reserved keyword.
1. boolean
2. byte
3. short
4. int
5. long
6. double
7. float
8. char

Q5. What are the identifiers in Java?

Ans:An identifier is a name given to a package, class, interface, method, or variable. All identifiers must have different names.

Q6. List the Operators in Java?

Ans: Operators in Java can be classified into 6 types:
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Assignment Operators
5. Unary Operators
6. Bitwise Operators

Q7. Explain about increment and decrement operators and give an examples

Ans: In programming , the increment operator ++ increases the value of a variable by 1. Similarly, the decrement operator -- decreases the value of a variable by 1.
