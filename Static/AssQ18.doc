Q1. Why do we need static keyword in Java. Explain with an example.

Ans:The static keyword is mainly used for memory management in Java. A static keyword can 
be applied to variables, blocks, methods and classes. The static keyword is a property 
of a class rather than an instance of the class. The static keyword is used for a constant 
variable or a method that is the same for every instance of a class.

Q2. What is class loading and how does the Java program actually executes?

Ans:In Java, classloading is the process of loading class files into the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) at runtime. It is responsible for loading classes from various sources, such as the file system, network, and databases, and making them available to the JVM for execution.

The class loading process in Java is divided into three phases: loading, linking, and initialization.

1. Loading: In the loading phase, the classloader locates the class file using the fully qualified class name,reads the class file, and converts it into a Class Object. The Class Object contains the metadata of the class,such as the fields, methods, and constructors.

2. Linking: In the linking phase, the JVM performs several operations in the Class Object, such as verifying the class file's integrity, resolving symbolic references, and allocating memory for the class variables.

3. Initialization: In the initialization phase, the JVM initializes the class variables with their default values, and runs the class's static initialization block (if any).

Q3. Can we mark a local variable as static?

Ans:Yes

Q4. Why is the static block executed before the main method in Java?

Ans:The static block always executes first before the main() method in Java because the 
compiler stores them in memory at the time of class loading and before the object 
creation. Here, the compiler executes all the static blocks first, and after finishing 
the static block execution, it invokes the main() method.

Q5. Why is a static method also called a class method?

Ans:A static method is a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class. This means you can call a static method without creating an object of the class. Static methods are sometimes called class methods.


Q6. What is the use of Static blocks in Java?

Ans: If we want to perform any activity at the time of loading a .class file we have to define that activity inside the static block.
Normally a static block is used to perform initialization of the static variables.

Q7. Difference between static and instance variables?

Ans:Static variables:
1. These variables are called “class variables”.
2. These variables will get memory in the method area.
3. If the value does not change from object to object then we need to use static variables.
4. Inside a static area we can access static variables only.
5. Static variables are created using static keywords.

Instance variables:
1. These variables will get memory in the heap area.
2. If the value changes from object to object then we need to use “non-static” variables.
3. Inside a nonstatic area we can access both static and non-static variables.
4. Non-static variables are created without using the “static” keyword.

Q8. Difference between static and non static members?

Ans:Static members:
1. These variables are called “class variables”.
2. These variables will get memory in the method area.
3. If the value does not change from object to object then we need to use static variables.
4. Inside a static area we can access static variables only.
5. Static variables are created using static keywords.

Non-static members:
1. These variables will get memory in the heap area.
2. If the value changes from object to object then we need to use “non-static” variables.
3. Inside a nonstatic area we can access both static and non-static variables.
4. Non-static variables are created without using the “static” keyword.
5. These "ariables are called “instance "ariables”I
