Q1. What is Input and Output stream in java?

Ans:A stream can be defined as a sequence of data. The InputStream is used to read data
from a source and the OutputStream is used for writing data to a destination.

Q2. What are the methods of OutputStream?

Ans:write()->writes the specified byte to the Output stream.
write(byte[] array)->writes the bytes from the specified array to the Output stream.
flush()->forces to write all data present in the Output stream to the destination.
close()->closes the Output stream.

Q3. What is serialization in java?

Ans:serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to 
transfer it over a network or to store it in a file or database.In java, serialization
is done by implementing the serializable interface.

Q4. What is the serializable interface in java?

Ans:The serializable interface in java is a marker interface that has no methods.It is 
used to mark classes that can be serialized , meaning their object instances can be 
converted into a stream of bytes.

Q5. What is deserilization in java?

Ans:deserilization is the process of converting a stream of bytes back into an object 
instance. This is done after an object has been serialized.

Q6. How is serialization acheived in java?

Ans:serialization is acheived in java by implementing the serializable interface.When an
object is serialized , its state is converted into a stream of bytes, which can then 
be trasnferred over a network or stored in a file or database.

Q7. How is deserilization acheived in java?

Ans:deserilization is acheived in java by reading a stream of bytes and using them to 
recreate the original object instance.This is done by calling the readObject() method 
of ObjectInputStream instance.

Q8. How can you avoid certain number of variables of class from getting serialized?

Ans:Mark member variables as static or transient, and those member variables will no
more be a part serialization.

Q9. What classes are available in the java IO File Classes API?

Ans:The following classes are available in the Java IO API and are important to work 
with files in Java.
File
RandomAccessFile
FileInputStream
FileReader
FileOutputStream
FileWriter

Q10. What is difference between Externalizable and serialization interface?

Ans:1.Methods 
serializable:It is a marker interface and it doesn't have any methods.
Externalizable:It's not a marker interface. It has method's called writeExternal() 
and readExternal();

2.Default serialization process.
serializable:Yes, serializable provides its own default serialization process , we just 
need to implement a serializable interface.
Externalizable:No, we need to override writeExternal() and readExternal() for the 
serialization process to happen.

3.Constructor call during deserilization
serializable:Constructor is not called during deserilization.
Externalizable:Constructor is called during deserilization.
