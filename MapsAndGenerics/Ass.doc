Q1. What is a Map in Java?

Ans:A map contains values on the basis of key , i.e key and value pair. Each key and value
pair is known as an entry. A Map contains unique keys.
A Map is useful if you have to search , update or delete elements on the basis of a key.

Q2. What are the commonly used implementations of Map in Java?

Ans:There are two interfaces for implementing Map in java: Map and SortedMap, and three 
classes : HashMap, LinkedHashMap and TreeMap.

Q3. What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?

Ans:HashMap is an ordered collection that uses hashing to store the key-value pairs, 
while TreeMap is a sorted collection that stores the key-value pairs in a sorted order
based on the natural order of the keys or a custom Comparator.

Q4. How do you check if a key exists in a Map in Java?

Ans:We can check if a key exists in a Map in Java using the containsKey() method or the 
get() method.The containsKey() method returns a boolean value indicating whether the Map
contains the specified key, while the get() method returns the value associated with the 
specified key, or null if the key is not present in the Map.

Q5. What are generics in Java?

Ans:generics in java are used to provide type safety and code redundancy by allowing 
the use of generic types.It allows classes, methods , and interfaces to be written 
generically , without specifying the type of data being used.

Q6. What are the benefits of usign generics in java?

Ans:The benefits of using generics in java are:type safety, code reusability , improved
readability, reduced code redundancy and improved performance.

Q7. What is a generic class in Java?

Ans:A generic class in java is a class that can work with different types of data.It is 
defined using a type parameter enclosed in angle brackets, which represents the type of 
data being used.
Example: Single type parameter

class Solution<T>
{
   T data;
   public static T getData(){
       return data;
   }
}
Example: Multiple type parameters


public class Pair<K, V> {

    private K key;
    private V value;

    public Pair(K key, V value) {
    this.key = key;
    this.value = value;
    }

    public K getKey()    { return key; }
    public V getValue() { return value; }
}

Q8. What is Type parameter in java generics?

Ans:A Type parameter in java generics is a placeholder for the type of data that is used 
by a generic class or method. It is defined using a single uppercase letter enclosed in
angle brackets, such as <T> or <E>.

Q9. What is a Generic method in java?

Ans:A Generic method in java is a method that can work with different types of data.It is
defined using a type parameter enclosed in angle brackets, which represents the type 
of data being used.

Q10. What is the difference between ArrayList and ArrayList<T>?

Ans:ArrayList is a non-generic class, while ArrayList<T> is a generic class.ArrayList<T>
provides type safety, as it can only store elements of the specified type, whereas
ArrayList can store any type of element.
