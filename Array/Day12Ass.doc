Ans: Single Dimension Array

 int[] a//recommended to use as variable is separated from tdpeÃ
 int a[]
 int []a
 int[6] a // compile time error. we cannot specifd the size.

 2-D Array

 Declaration(All are valid)

int[][] a ;
int a[][];
int [][]a;
int[] []a;
int[] a[];
int []a[];

Q3. Can we change the size of an array at run time?

Q6. What is a 1D array with an example?

 Q7. Write a program on a 2D array?

 Ans:class Test
{    
    public static void main(String [] args)
    {
        int arr[][]={{1,2},{3,4},{4}};
        for(int a[]:arr)
        {
            for(int b:a)
            {
                System.out.print(b + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
           
        }
    }
